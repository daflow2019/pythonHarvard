Run this class on a random list of 10 integers. You will need to define your own fitness function, but I think one whereby it counts all *already sorted* elements in the list sounds pretty good to me! We will look for your use of recursion/iteration as needed, class objects as needed and functions. You can start with the function below and modify. <p><b>Points: 30</b></p>"

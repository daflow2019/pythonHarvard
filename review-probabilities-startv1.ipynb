    "# Napoleon's Russian campaign and CSCI E7\n",
    "\n",
    "The year is 1812, and Napoleon is doing pretty well for himself. He has most of Europe under his control, except for the UK. No matter how many times he tried to invade them, he couldn’t break through their defenses. His plan was to place an embargo on them, forcing the other European countries to stop trade with the UK which would weaken them enough so that Napoleon could invade and take over easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Czar Alexander of Russia sees that Napoleon was becoming too powerful, so he refuses to participate in this embargo. Angry at Czar Alexander’s decision, Napoleon gathers a massive army of over 400,000 to attack Russia in June of the year 1812. While Russia’s troops are not as numerous as France’s, Russia has a plan. Russian troops keep retreating as Napoleon’s troops move forward, burning everything they pass, ensuring that the French forces could not take anything from their environment. Eventually the French army follows the Russian army all the way to Moscow during October, suffering major losses from lack of food. By the time Napoleon gets to Moscow, he knows he has to retreat. As winter settles into Europe and the temperature drops, Napoleon’s troops suffer even more losses, returning to France from lack of food, disease, and weather conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Minard’s graphic is quite clever because of its ability to combine all of dimensions: loss of life at a time and location, temperature, geography, historical context, into one single graphic. He shows these various details without distracting text or labels as well. He is able to show the drastic loss in life from Napoleon’s decision in just a single corner of the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The year is 2019, far far away from Russia and far into the future, in a land called **Harvard**, CSCI E-7 should not suffer the same fate. Initially I was planning on digging deeper into ontologies to show you how you can capture knowledge and then run queries on the capture in order to make deductions. Then, venture into molecular dynamics and visualization. But based on class feedback, we're going to regroup and not follow the french into history. Instead, we're going to regroup and prepare for the battle of all battles: **your final exam**, about which I want you to *look forward with anticipation* rather than bracing for impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're going to spend next lectures in review mode. We're going to go back to our material using different examples drawn from life sciences, and ensure you *completely* understand what we covered. My hope is that with all of this python you've been doing:\n",

    "There was strategy in your last homework. TAs are telling me that frequently you would take random guesses at python code for your solutions. That means to me that you are unsure about your **reasoning**. That is why from now on I want you to provide **pseudo-code** for your solutions, *followed* by your **code**. We'll train on this.

We can start with the live cells, and also add any cells neighboring the live cells. An easy way to generate this dict is to create a `Counter` and pass it every neighbor of every live cell. This may feel like we're doing the counting \"backwards.\" Instead of asking \"for each cell, how many live neighbors does it have?\" we are saying \"for each live cell, increment the count of each of its neighbors.\" The two amount to the same thing because *neighbor* is symmetric&mdash;if P is a neighbor of Q, then Q is a neighbor of P. Below we see the neighbor counts for each of the three generations; in each generation the top diagram gives the neighbor counts for the empty cells, and the bottom diagram gives the counts for the live cells. This is just to make the diagram easier to read; in the code these are combined into one `Counter`."
